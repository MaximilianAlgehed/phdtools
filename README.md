PhD tools
=========

A set of tools which may be useful to PhD students, teachers and others who
may need to keep track of hours spent, do text processing and other fun
things.


Programs
--------

  * crepes: Course REPorting Excellence System - a program to keep track of
    the hours spent on courses and other projects.

  * mkreply: build texts using templates and simple variable substitution.
    Useful for generating rejection messages for lab submissions from a list
    of canned responses, since students generally all make the same mistakes.
